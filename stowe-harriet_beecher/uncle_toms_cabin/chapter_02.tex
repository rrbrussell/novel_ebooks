\chapter{The Mother}

Eliza had been brought up by her mistress, from girlhood, as a petted and
indulged favorite.

The traveller in the south must often have remarked the peculiar air of
refinement, that softness of voice and manner, which seems in many cases to be
a particular gift to the quadroon and mulatto women. The natural graces in the
quadroon are often united with beauty of the most dazzling kind, and in almost
every case with a personal appearance prepossessing and agreeable. Eliza, such
as we have described her, is not a fancy sketch, but taken from rememberance, as
we saw her years ago in Kentucky.
